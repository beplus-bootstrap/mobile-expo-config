# @beplus-bootstrap/mobile-expo-config Expo Plugin


## What is this?

This is a **rough PoC** of an [Expo Plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/plugins-and-mods) that together with [`expo prebuild`](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild) and [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation) transforms the generated native Android and iOS projects for your [Expo](https://expo.dev) App to be compatible with [beplus Bootstrap Mobile](https://github.com/beplus-bootstrap/mobile).


## What does it mean, exactly…

### What is [Expo](https://expo.dev)?
Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS (and the web) with JavaScript and React. It's a whole ecosystem of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that simplifies React Native development.

### What is [Expo Prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild)?
`expo prebuild` is a command that generates native Android and iOS project files from your Expo App. This allows you to use native code and libraries that are not available as Expo managed workflow modules. Essentially, it bridges the gap between Expo's managed workflow and the bare workflow, giving developers more flexibility while still benefiting from Expo's powerful tools and services.

### What is [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation)?
Continuous Native Generation is an abstract concept that describes the process of generating ephemeral native projects from a set of inputs. It allows you to manage and update the native project files automatically. Whenever there are changes in your Expo configuration or dependencies, CNG ensures that the native code is up-to-date without requiring manual intervention. This helps maintain consistency and reduces the complexity of managing native code in an Expo App.

### What is [beplus Bootstrap Mobile](https://github.com/beplus-bootstrap/mobile)?
beplus Bootstrap Mobile is an opinionated React Native finisher kit that dramatically speeds up the development and deployment process of your App, regardless whether you're using React Native CLI or Expo.

When using Expo together with this Plugin, your native Android and iOS project files, generated by [`expo prebuild`](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild), will be compatible with the native Android and iOS projects by beplus Bootstrap Mobile.

**beplus Bootstrap Mobile comes cleaned-up & [refined](https://docs.be.plus/training/playbooks/mobile/basics/refinement)**:
- with multiple environments support (think of `dev`, `stage`, `prod`), so you can clearly separate them and have all of the apps installed on a simulator or device at the same time,
- configurable by environment variables, whether in your React Native Javascript code, or within the native Android or iOS project(s),
- adding basic [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) integration to automate the common tasks,
- and much more…

It also defines an overall naming convention for environment variables to bring consistency across multiple projects, especially when we're speaking about the deployment.

especially their **Configuration** Section(s), and you can see what I'm talking about.

## Reasoning

Maintaining the native Android and iOS projects is hard. A single native project on its own is complicated to maintain, scale, and update. In a cross-platform app, you have multiple native projects that you must manage and keep up to date. That's why Expo is so popular – it abstracts the complicated stuff and tries to make it easy. And it's true – to certain extent.

While there are countless discussions whether Expo or React Native CLI - I think we can agree that Expo is much easier to start with, but React Native CLI is more of an "industry standard" when it comes to more complex applications.

> _Expo is easy, until it isn't. React Native CLI is hard, until it isn't._

Once you reach the point when Expo is "not enough" – or – managing the native Android and iOS is worth it … and you're familiar enough with the native development (or at least native project(s) management), React Native CLI is (or will be) the next step.

… **and that's why [beplus Bootstrap Mobile](https://github.com/beplus-bootstrap/mobile) supports both and brings consistency between the two**.

## Usage

```js filename="app.config.ts"
…
import {
  withBeplusBootstrapMobile,
  withBeplusBootstrapMobileForIos,
  withBeplusBootstrapMobileForAndroid,
  withBeplusBootstrapMobileFastlane,
} from "@beplus-bootstrap/mobile-expo-config";
…
export default ({ config }: ConfigContext): ExpoConfig => ({
  …
  plugins: [
    [withBeplusBootstrapMobile],
    [withBeplusBootstrapMobileForIos],
    [withBeplusBootstrapMobileForAndroid],
    [withBeplusBootstrapMobileFastlane],
    …
  ],
  …
});
```
